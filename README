This is the source code of CarryU iOS App.

The basic idea is by using LoL XMPP account to get user's real time game status, then remotely call CarryU server to update user's battle information from LoL RTMP server.

BTW, this project is based on iOS 6.0 SDK, and cocoapods(please check the Podfile.lock version information before building from source).
